## About The Project

**Entropy** is more than just a password generator; it's a testament to modern web design and client-side functionality. What started as a simple idea evolved into a fully-featured application with a custom dark theme, a mesmerizing animated background, and a highly intuitive user interface. 

This project was built from the ground up with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating the power of modern web standards without relying on heavy frameworks. Every element, from the custom-styled radio buttons to the animated input fields, has been carefully crafted for a seamless user experience.
